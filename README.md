## Inspiration

Martin came up with the idea for a web game that works similar to the famous dinosaur web game, but it is with track athletes.

## What it does

The project has a login page, account creation, main menu page with basic UI for, settings, high score, achievments, character selection, and the game itself.

## How we built it

Martin created the menu pages, Asher made the login portal and helped Martin, and I made the basic version of the game. 

## Next Steps

As we move forward we hope to be able to make stages within the infinite scrolling game, create skins and selection for skins, add more basic features such as pause functionality, adjustable settings, acheivemnt system, and leader board rankings of players.
